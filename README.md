# Detecting-Brain-Neuronal-Movement-using-Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients
Uses brain MRImages from various diseases like Fatal Stroke, Tumor, Alzheimers etc..
<br>The interface notebook is a sample notebook represents how HOG features are extracted and how svm is used for prediction of a disease.<br>
The svm_model.joblib is used to save the trained model.

<p> Abstract:
In recent years, artificial intelligence has been applied to problems in medical imaging, and in particular to medical imaging of the central nervous system. Many AI &ML innovations include image quality, and automatic classification of disease. In this, the movement of neurons in our brain are detected. And if there are any deviations from their usual behavior, this suggests that the person has a brain disorder. These deviations are observed by mapping with normal human brain image. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique is used to convert the MR image to a graph, which is then compared to a normal brain graph. This algorithm is also used in computer vision and image processing for purpose of object detection. And Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Binary classification algorithm is used for classifying the images</p>
